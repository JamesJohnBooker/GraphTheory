# GraphTheory
This script contains functions to analyse properties of a graph. Inputting a graph as a 2D array, the script can be used to determine whether or not there is an edge from one vertex to another, what the minimum distance from one vertex to every other vertex is (or if they are even connected) and whether or not the entire graph is connected (that is, whether or not there is a path between any two verties in the graph).
